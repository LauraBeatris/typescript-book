Throughout my TypeScript journey, modules will be added with usage examples according to each topic on this repository.

Here you can refer to the modules structured by learning area, that can be used as examples for your learning journey as well.

- [Template Literals](./src/learning/typescript-core/template-literals.ts): From TypeScript 4.1, Template Literals help to create object types, split strings into tuples and other useful transformations.
- [Type Helpers](./src/learning/typescript-core/type-helpers.ts): Building type helpers on top of the ones within the language, as well setting constraints that ensure the flexibility and reusability of types.
- [Unions and Indexing](./src/learning/typescript-core/unions-and-indexing.ts): Learn the difference between Unions and Discriminated Unions, how to access their properties with indexed access types and the usage of built-in utility types.
- [Conditional Types](./src/learning/typescript-core/conditional-types.ts): Integrate conditional types along type helpers, as well as learning the use cases behind the `infer` keyword.
- [Mapped Types](./src/learning/typescript-core/mapped-types.ts): Transform any type into and out of objects, unions, and tuples.
